# Double slit python simulation
This is a physics simulation of a classical 2D wave using the finite step method.
Simulates the double slit (Young's) experiment. It implements a rectangular 2D region, a doble slit and a screen to compare the maximus of the interference pattern and the theoretical prediction of its locations.
___
It uses the SciPy python module, so you need to intall the module in order to run the simulation.
To run the simulation just execute the `main.py` file.

You can edit the parameters of the simulation by changing the values of the 'editable parameters' in the  `main.py` file
> Lines 9 to 35

The animation can be store in  a `.mp4` file. To do that, uncomment lines `86` and `87`, the name of the final file can be edited.
